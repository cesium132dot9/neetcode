# Solution: 
Have a dictionary which mapped the numbers to their frequencies. Then found the max frequencies. Then added the original numbers to a list/array respectively.

## Java: 
- `PriorityQueue` to determine the max frequency numbers
- `Map.Entry<k, v>` to store the number to frequency in the priority queue
- Lambda functions in java are written as `(inputs) -> output`
