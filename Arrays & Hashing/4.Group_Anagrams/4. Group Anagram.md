# Solution: 
Converted words into tuples which contained letters and the letter's number of occurence. Stored this tuple as a key in a dictionary/hashmap for easy lookup. Returned only the values of the hashmap. 

## Python: 
- `sorted()` returns a list
- Creating the key tuple   ^adf866
    - `Counter()` returns a tuple of letters used and the count of each 
    - `ord(char) - ord('a')` maps lowercase letter to a 0-25 index  
## Java: 
- Two arrays with same contents are considered different 
    - Never use arrays as hashmap keys
    - Arrays compares **object identity** intead of contents 
- Hashmaps
    - The `computeIfAbsent()` method takes in the key, and a function 
- Type declarations in java is very annoying
