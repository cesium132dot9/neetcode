# Solution: 
Used a set to keep track of the numbers that appeared. Then check if the same number has appeared again.  

## C++
-	For loops and enhanced for loops have the same syntax as Java
	-	Enhanced for loops; `for (type var : collection)`
-	unordered_set vs set
    - set automatically orders the numbers in ascending order
        - Strange considering sets in math are unordered 
-	`.count()` behaviour for sets
    - Used to see if a set contains a number
